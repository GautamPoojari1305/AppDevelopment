Objective:
To learn how to connect a Flutter app with an external REST API and dynamically display data â€” in this case, a list of anime wallpapers.

Overview:

Integrated a public Wallpaper API (e.g., Wallhaven API) into a Flutter app.

Used the http package to send GET requests and retrieve wallpaper data in JSON format.

Parsed the response to extract image URLs and displayed them using widgets like Image.network or CachedNetworkImage.

Outcome:
The experiment demonstrates how REST APIs enable real-time data fetching, dynamic content updates, and seamless integration with external data sources. The app successfully loads and displays wallpapers fetched from the API.

Tools Used:

Flutter / Android Studio

REST API (e.g., Wallhaven API)

HTTP & JSON parsing (http package)
