Experiment No. 9

Integrating SQLite in To-Do List & Calculator Apps

Objective:
To understand how local databases work by adding SQLite functionality to a To-Do List and Calculator app.

Overview:

To-Do List App:
Integrated SQLite to store, update, and delete tasks locally. This allows users to keep their data even after closing the app.

Calculator App:
Added SQLite to log previous calculations and display a history of operations. Users can view, clear, or reuse previous results.

Outcome:
The experiment demonstrates how SQLite provides offline data persistence, fast access, and lightweight local storage â€” making it ideal for mobile apps without requiring internet access.
