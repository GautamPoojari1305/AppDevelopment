# Registration Form Experiment

This project is a simple experiment to create a registration form using various HTML input types. The goal is to demonstrate the implementation of a user-friendly form that includes:

* **Text fields:** For user input like name and email.
* **Radio buttons:** To select a single option from a group.
* **Dropdowns:** To choose an option from a list.

The form is built with basic HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for any interactive functionality or validation. It serves as a foundational example for beginners learning web development.
